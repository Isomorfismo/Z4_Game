# The Z4 Game

Lights Out Z‚ÇÑ with Chebyshev Neighborhood

This is a variant of the classic Lights Out puzzle, implemented in Python with Pygame.
Instead of binary lights, the game uses arrows with 4 possible states (mod 4 arithmetic).

Clicking a cell rotates all arrows in its 3√ó3 Chebyshev neighborhood (the cell and its 8 neighbors) by +1 mod 4.
The goal is to make all arrows point up (state 0).

‚ú® Features

- Z‚ÇÑ mechanics: each cell has 4 states instead of 2.
- Chebyshev neighborhood: pressing affects the clicked cell and its surrounding 8.
- Optimal solver: uses modular linear algebra to compute a minimum-move solution.
- Hint system: shows a recommended next move.
- Auto-solver: demonstrates the minimum sequence of moves step by step.
- Customization mode: toggleable mode that lets you rotate individual cells (without affecting neighbors) to design your own puzzles.

üéÆ Controls

Click on a cell ‚Üí rotate its neighborhood by +1 (mod 4).

Buttons:
- Personalize: toggle customization mode (rotate single cells only).
- Hint: show an optimal next move.
- Solve: watch the puzzle auto-solve.
- New: generate a random board.

üì¶ Installation

üßÆ How It Works

The game board is a 4√ó4 grid with states in ‚Ñ§‚ÇÑ.

Pressing a cell adds +1 mod 4 to all cells in its 3√ó3 neighborhood.

The solver builds and inverts a mod 4 matrix system to find an optimal solution.

Customization mode is useful for testing puzzles and creating your own challenges.
